                control output with fields numSeries (number of sensitivity 
                estimates extracted from control run), correlations (correlation 
                coefficient of CMD projection time series with
                TSI record), sensitivities (response coefficient of CMD projection
                time series with TSI record), regSeries (projection time series found for
                run), cmdSet (zonal-mean composite mean difference fields

                output with fields bMat (response coefficients for predictors
                constant, TSI, Anthropogenic, Volcanism, ENSO), bIntMat 
                (regression error for response coefficient estimates), vPMat
                (variance in monthly temperature anomalies explained by MLR model),
                pathTas (filename of TAS output used), pathTos (filename of TOS
                output used for Niño 3.4 calculation), T (global monthly tempearture
                anomalies), lags (lags, in months, found to maximize explained variance).
                Number of rows in bMat reflects the number of sensitivity estimates 
                calculated using overlapping subsets of the full control run.
